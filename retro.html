            When Joe Dumars was hired by the struggling Detroit Pistons to be team president 
            after the 1999-2000 season, he couldn’t have predicted what awaited his team four 
            seasons later. The Pistons had not advanced beyond the first round of the playoffs 
            since 1991 and had missed the playoffs in four of the previous eight seasons prior to 
            Dumars’ hiring.Everything was about to change. <br></p>
        <p>
            In the epitome of team-ball over star power, the Pistons would become 
            one of the most unlikely champions when they defeated a Los Angeles Lakers 
            team sporting four future Hall of Famers 4-1 in the 2004 Finals. The victory 
            is considered one of the greatest upsets in U.S. pro sports history
