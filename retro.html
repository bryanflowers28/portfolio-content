    When Joe Dumars was hired by the struggling Detroit Pistons to be team president 
    after the 1999-2000 season, he couldn’t have predicted what awaited his team four 
    seasons later. The Pistons had not advanced beyond the first round of the playoffs 
    since 1991 and had missed the playoffs in four of the previous eight seasons prior to 
    Dumars’ hiring.Everything was about to change. <br></p>
<p>
    In the epitome of team-ball over star power, the Pistons would become 
    one of the most unlikely champions when they defeated a Los Angeles Lakers 
    team sporting four future Hall of Famers 4-1 in the 2004 Finals. The victory 
    is considered one of the greatest upsets in U.S. pro sports history
