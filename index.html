        The Detroit Pistons are an American professional basketball team 
        based in Auburn Hills, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. The Pistons 
        compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member 
        club of the leagueâ€™s Eastern Conference Central Division. The team 
        plays its home games at Little Ceasers Arena and was founded 
        in Fort Wayne, Indiana as the Fort Wayne (Zollner) Pistons in 1941,
        a member of the National Basketball League (NBL). <br></p>

        The Pistons joined the Basketball Association of America (BAA) 
        in 1948. In 1949, the NBL and BAA merged to become the NBA, 
        and the Pistons became part of the merged league. Since moving 
        to Detroit in 1957, the Pistons have won three NBA championships 
        in 1989, 1990 and 2004.
