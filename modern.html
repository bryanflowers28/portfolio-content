            Today the Pistons are in a rebuilding phase, one of the few times in the franchises history where this is the case.
            In recent memory the Pistons legacy has been nothing more than first round playoff exits and dissapointing draft picks.
            From missing on superstars in the draft to regularly getting blown out by the better squads in the east, and this season has been much of the same<br></p>
        <p>
            But the Pistons were up front about what this season would entail from the moment they introduced 
            Troy Weaver as general manager last June and began improving their young core. In a stroke of luck, the Pistons were granted 
            the #1 overall pick in the 2021 draft. This blessing was used to draft superstar young talent Cade Cunningham. Paired with other 
            young stars such as Sadiq Bey and Isaiah Steward, perhaps the Pistons are getting back on the right track.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the season progressed, our young stars show more and more promise with each game they play. Cade Cunningham,
            who got off to a somewhat shaky start, has found his footing in the city of Detroit, deliviering some performances
            that are not often seen from rookies. He is now one of the three finalists for rookie of the year. Sadiq Bey became one of the
            only rookies ever to record a 50 point game. The future looks bright in Detroit as the coaches and players attempt to restore
            the team to its former glory.
