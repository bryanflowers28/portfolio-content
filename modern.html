<p>
    The Pistons hit the halfway point of the season
     and in this radically unusual season, the All-Star break really is the halfway point 
     with a 10-26 record. And if this were a year ago and if you were into the whole mid-semester 
     grades exercise, that would earn the franchise a big, fat F. <br></p>
<p>
    But the Pistons were up front about what this season would entail from the moment they introduced 
    Troy Weaver as general manager last June and, in fact, from before that â€“ from the February 2020 
    trade of Andre Drummond.
