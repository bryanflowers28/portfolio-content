            The Detroit Pistons are often overlooked when people talk about 
            the best NBA teams of all time but the 1988-90 squads absolutely 
            deserve to be on that list. Looking back, those Bad Boy Pistons teams were some of the most dominant to ever play the games.
            Led by all star guards Isaiah Thomas and Joe Dumars, They were able to capture 3 finals appearances and 2 championships. <br></p>
        <p>
            In the process, beating what some people consider to be the best teams and players of all time. More specifically,
            the Los Angeles Lakers, The Boston Celtics, and The Chicago Bulls. Yet they still remain underrated. 
            This is ironic considering the Detroit Pistons were the only team to beat all three of those teams, most of which in their prime.
