    The Detroit Pistons are often overlooked when people talk about 
    the best NBA teams of all time but the 1988-89 squad absolutely 
    deserves to be on that list.. <br></p>
<p>
    This is ironic considering the Detroit Pistons were the only team 
    to beat all three of those teams, yet, theyâ€™ve somehow been reduced
     to side characters in the era.
